Content: GOAL: Find how many days until warmer temperature for each day.

PROBLEM:
Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

CONSTRAINTS:
- 1 <= temperatures.length <= 10^5
- 30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100
- Must implement O(n) time complexity solution
- O(n) space complexity allowed

INPUT FORMAT:
An array of integers representing daily temperatures.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return an array of integers where each element represents days until warmer temperature.

TASK:
Solve this problem and provide your solution with explanation.

EXAMPLE 1:
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
Explanation:
- Day 0 (73): next warmer is day 1 (74) → wait 1 day
- Day 1 (74): next warmer is day 2 (75) → wait 1 day
- Day 2 (75): next warmer is day 6 (76) → wait 4 days
- Day 3 (71): next warmer is day 5 (72) → wait 2 days
- Day 4 (69): next warmer is day 5 (72) → wait 1 day
- Day 5 (72): next warmer is day 6 (76) → wait 1 day
- Day 6 (76): no warmer future day → wait 0 days
- Day 7 (73): no warmer future day → wait 0 days

EXAMPLE 2:
Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]

EXAMPLE 3:
Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]

EXAMPLE 4:
Input: temperatures = [50,40,30,20,10]
Output: [0,0,0,0,0]

MODEL REASONING (Chain of Thought):
============================================================

We are given a classic "Daily Temperatures" problem, which is essentially finding the next greater element's index difference for each element in an array. The constraints require O(n) time and O(n) space.

The typical solution uses a monotonic decreasing stack (where we store indices of temperatures that haven't found a warmer day yet). We iterate through the array, and for each temperature, we check if it is warmer than the temperature at the index stored at the top of the stack. If it is, we pop that index and compute the difference in days (current index - popped index). We continue popping until the stack is empty or the top of the stack's temperature is not less than the current temperature. Then we push the current index onto the stack.

This ensures each index is pushed and popped at most once, leading to O(n) time.

Let's outline the algorithm:

Initialize an array `answer` of the same length as `temperatures` with all zeros.
Initialize an empty stack (which will store indices).
Iterate over each day `i` from 0 to n-1:
    While stack is not empty and `temperatures[i]` > `temperatures[stack[-1]]`:
        pop the top index `prev_index` from stack.
        set `answer[prev_index] = i - prev_index`
    Push `i` onto stack.

After the loop, any indices left in the stack have no warmer future day, so their answer remains 0 (already initialized).

Let's test with example 1:

temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Initialize: answer = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], stack = []

i=0, temp=73: stack empty, push 0 -> stack=[0]
i=1, temp=74: while stack not empty and 74 > 73: pop 0, answer[0]=1-0=1. Push 1 -> stack=[1]
i=2, temp=75: 75 > 74? Yes, pop 1, answer[1]=2-1=1. Push 2 -> stack=[2]
i=3, temp=71: 71 > 75? No. Push 3 -> stack=[2,3]
i=4, temp=69: 69 > 71? No. Push 4 -> stack=[2,3,4]
i=5, temp=72: while stack not empty and 72 > temperatures[stack[-1]] = temperatures[4]=69: pop 4, answer[4]=5-4=1. Now stack top is 3, temperatures[3]=71, 72>71: pop 3, answer[3]=5-3=2. Now stack top is 2, temperatures[2]=75, 72>75? No. Stop. Push 5 -> stack=[2,5]
i=6, temp=76: while stack not empty and 76 > temperatures[stack[-1]] = temperatures[5]=72: pop 5, answer[5]=6-5=1. Now stack top is 2, temperatures[2]=75, 76>75: pop 2, answer[2]=6-2=4. Stack empty. Push 6 -> stack=[6]
i=7, temp=73: 73 > 76? No. Push 7 -> stack=[6,7]
End. Answers: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0] as expected.

We should return the answer array.

Edge cases: If array length is 1, answer is [0]. If array is decreasing, no pops happen, all answers 0.

Given constraints, we must ensure O(n) time.

Now, implement the solution in Python.

We'll provide a function:

def dailyTemperatures(temperatures):
    n = len(temperatures)
    answer = [0] * n
    stack = []  # stores indices
    for i, t in enumerate(temperatures):
        while stack and t > temperatures[stack[-1]]:
            prev_index = stack.pop()
            answer[prev_index] = i - prev_index
        stack.append(i)
    return answer

This meets the constraints.

Now, we need to output the solution with explanation. The problem statement asks: "Solve this problem and provide your solution with explanation."

We'll present the solution in the response.

I'll write a clear explanation and then the code.

MODEL RESPONSE:
============================================================

The problem requires finding, for each day, the number of days until a warmer temperature occurs. This is a classic next greater element problem, but instead of the value itself, we need the distance (index difference). An efficient solution can be achieved using a monotonic decreasing stack, which allows us to process each element in linear time.

### Approach
We use a stack to keep track of indices for which we haven't yet found a warmer day. The stack maintains indices in such a way that the temperatures at these indices are in decreasing order from bottom to top. As we iterate through the array, for each temperature, we compare it with the temperatures at indices stored in the stack. If the current temperature is higher, it means we've found a warmer day for the index at the top of the stack. We then pop that index, compute the difference in days (current index minus popped index), and store it in the result array. We continue this process until the stack is empty or the current temperature is not greater than the temperature at the top of the stack. Finally, we push the current index onto the stack.

This approach ensures each index is pushed and popped at most once, giving us O(n) time complexity. The space complexity is O(n) for the stack and result array.

### Solution Code
```python
def dailyTemperatures(temperatures):
    n = len(temperatures)
    answer = [0] * n
    stack = []
    
    for i, temp in enumerate(temperatures):
        while stack and temp > temperatures[stack[-1]]:
            prev_index = stack.pop()
            answer[prev_index] = i - prev_index
        stack.append(i)
    
    return answer
```

### Explanation
1. Initialize an array `answer` with zeros and an empty stack.
2. Iterate through each temperature with its index:
   - While the stack is not empty and the current temperature is greater than the temperature at the index on top of the stack:
     - Pop the index from the stack.
     - Set the answer for that index to the difference between the current index and the popped index (days waited).
   - Push the current index onto the stack.
3. After processing all days, any indices remaining in the stack have no warmer future day, so their answers remain zero (as initialized).

### Examples
**Example 1:**  
Input: `temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]`  
Output: `[1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]`  
The algorithm processes as described in the problem statement.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `temperatures = [30,40,50,60]`  
Output: `[1,1,1,0]`  
Each day except the last has a warmer next day.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `temperatures = [30,60,90]`  
Output: `[1,1,0]`  

**Example 4:**  
Input: `temperatures = [50,40,30,20,10]`  
Output: `[0,0,0,0,0]`  
No day has a warmer future day, so all answers are zero.

This solution efficiently handles the constraints with O(n) time and O(n) space.
