GOAL: Determine if a string containing brackets is valid
PROBLEM:
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type
CONSTRAINTS:
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
- s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'
- Must use O(n) time complexity where n is length of string
- Must use O(n) space complexity (stack-based approach expected)
INPUT FORMAT:
A single string containing only bracket characters.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return boolean true if valid, false otherwise.
TASK:
Solve this problem and provide your solution with explanation.
EXAMPLES:
Example 1:
Input: s = "()"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false

Example 4:
Input: s = "([)]"
Output: false

Example 5:
Input: s = "{[]}"
Output: true
