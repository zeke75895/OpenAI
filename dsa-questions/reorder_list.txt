GOAL: Reorder a singly linked list in a specific alternating pattern.

PROBLEM:
You are given the head of a singly linked list. The list can be represented as:
L0 → L1 → … → Ln-1 → Ln

Reorder the list to be in the following form:
L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → …

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves can be changed.

CONSTRAINTS:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 10^4]
- 0 <= Node.val <= 1000
- Must use O(n) time complexity
- Must use O(1) extra space (not counting the output list)
- Must modify the list in-place

INPUT FORMAT:
The head node of a singly linked list. Each node contains an integer value and a next pointer.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return the head of the reordered list (the original head node, but with reordered connections).

TASK:
Solve this problem and provide your solution with explanation.

EXAMPLE 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]
Explanation: Original: 1→2→3→4
Reordered: 1→4→2→3

EXAMPLE 2:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
Explanation: Original: 1→2→3→4→5
Reordered: 1→5→2→4→3

EXAMPLE 3:
Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: Single node, no reordering needed

EXAMPLE 4:
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: Two nodes: L0→L1 becomes L0→L1 (same as original)

EXAMPLE 5:
Input: head = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Explanation: Original: 1→2→3
Reordered: 1→3→2
