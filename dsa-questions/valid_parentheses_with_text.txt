GOAL: Extract and validate bracket sequences from text containing other characters.

PROBLEM:
Given a string s containing text with embedded brackets, extract all bracket characters and determine if they form a valid bracket sequence.

The valid bracket characters are: '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', ']'

Rules for validity:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order
3. Every close bracket must match the most recent unmatched open bracket

CONSTRAINTS:
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
- s can contain any printable ASCII characters (letters, digits, spaces, punctuation)
- Only consider bracket characters '()[]{}' for validation - ignore all other characters
- Must use O(n) time complexity where n is length of string
- Must use O(n) space complexity

INPUT FORMAT:
A single string that may contain text mixed with brackets.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return boolean true if the extracted bracket sequence is valid, false otherwise.

TASK:
Solve this problem and provide your solution with explanation.

EXAMPLE 1:
Input: s = "function call() { return [1, 2, 3]; }"
Output: true (extracted brackets: (){[]})

EXAMPLE 2:
Input: s = "if (x > 0 && (y < 5 || {z: [1,2]})) then process()"
Output: true (extracted brackets: ((){[]}()))

EXAMPLE 3:
Input: s = "The array was: [1, 2, (3}]) - this caused an error"
Output: false (extracted brackets: [(}]) - mismatched)

EXAMPLE 4:
Input: s = "Just regular text with no brackets"
Output: true (empty bracket sequence is valid)

EXAMPLE 5:
Input: s = "Nested: {outer [inner (deep) more] finally}"
Output: true (extracted brackets: {[(])} - wait, check carefully)
