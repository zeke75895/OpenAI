GOAL: Find how many days until warmer temperature for each day.

PROBLEM:
Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

CONSTRAINTS:
- 1 <= temperatures.length <= 10^5
- 30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100
- Must implement O(n) time complexity solution
- O(n) space complexity allowed

INPUT FORMAT:
An array of integers representing daily temperatures.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return an array of integers where each element represents days until warmer temperature.

TASK:
Solve this problem and provide your solution with explanation.

EXAMPLE 1:
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
Explanation:
- Day 0 (73): next warmer is day 1 (74) → wait 1 day
- Day 1 (74): next warmer is day 2 (75) → wait 1 day
- Day 2 (75): next warmer is day 6 (76) → wait 4 days
- Day 3 (71): next warmer is day 5 (72) → wait 2 days
- Day 4 (69): next warmer is day 5 (72) → wait 1 day
- Day 5 (72): next warmer is day 6 (76) → wait 1 day
- Day 6 (76): no warmer future day → wait 0 days
- Day 7 (73): no warmer future day → wait 0 days

EXAMPLE 2:
Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]

EXAMPLE 3:
Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]

EXAMPLE 4:
Input: temperatures = [50,40,30,20,10]
Output: [0,0,0,0,0]
