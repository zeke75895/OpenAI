Role: DEVELOPER
Content: You are a computer science college student. Solve the following DSA problem and provide your solution with explanation.
----------------------------------------
Role: USER
Content: GOAL: Determine if a string containing brackets is valid
PROBLEM:
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type
CONSTRAINTS:
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
- s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'
- Must use O(n) time complexity where n is length of string
- Must use O(n) space complexity (stack-based approach expected)
INPUT FORMAT:
A single string containing only bracket characters.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return boolean true if valid, false otherwise.
TASK:
Solve this problem and provide your solution with explanation.
EXAMPLES:
Example 1:
Input: s = "()"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false

Example 4:
Input: s = "([)]"
Output: false

Example 5:
Input: s = "{[]}"
Output: true

Let's carefully analyze the problem and develop an efficient solution.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We are given a string of brackets.
- The goal is to determine if all brackets are properly matched:
  - Each opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket of the same type.
  - Brackets must close in the correct order.

### Approach:
We can use a **stack** data structure for this problem:
- Traverse the string character by character.
- When an opening bracket is encountered, push it onto the stack.
- When a closing bracket is encountered:
  - Check if the stack is not empty.
  - Pop the top element from the stack.
  - Verify if the popped element matches the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket.
- At the end:
  - If the stack is empty, all brackets are properly closed and matched.
  - If not, the string is invalid.

### Implementation:
Let's implement the solution in Python:

```python
def isValid(s: str) -> bool:
    # Map of closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets
    bracket_map = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    stack = []

    for char in s:
        # If it's an opening bracket, push onto stack
        if char in '([{':
            stack.append(char)
        # If it's a closing bracket, check for matching opening bracket
        elif char in bracket_map:
            # If stack is empty or top doesn't match, invalid
            if not stack or stack[-1] != bracket_map[char]:
                return False
            # Pop the matched opening bracket
            stack.pop()
        else:
            # Invalid character (not in the specified set)
            return False

    # Valid if no unmatched brackets remain
    return len(stack) == 0
```

### Explanation:
- We use a dictionary `bracket_map` to quickly find matching brackets.
- For each character:
  - If it’s an opening bracket, push onto the stack.
  - If it’s a closing bracket, ensure the top of the stack has the matching opening bracket.
- After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, the brackets are valid.

### Time Complexity:
- We process each character once, so **O(n)**.

### Space Complexity:
- The stack could contain up to **O(n)** in the worst case (all opening brackets).

### Example Walkthrough:
For input: `()[]{}`
- `(`: push `'('`
- `)`: pop `'('`, check match
- `[`: push `'['`
- `]`: pop `'['`, check match
- `{`: push `'{'`
- `}`: pop `'{'`, check match
- End: stack is empty → return `True`.

This approach ensures an efficient, clean, and readable solution that meets all constraints.
