Role: DEVELOPER
Content: You are a computer science college student. Solve the following DSA problem and provide your solution with explanation.
----------------------------------------
Role: USER
Content: GOAL: Find how many days unt l warmer temperature for each day.

PROBLEM:
Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

CONSTRAINTS:
- 1 <= temperatures.length <= 10^5
- 30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100
- Must implement O(n) time complexity solution
- O(n) space complexity allowed

INPUT FORMAT:
An array of integers representing daily temperatures.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return an array of integers where each element represents days until warmer temperature.

TASK:
Solve this problem and provide your solution with explanation.

EXAMPLE 1:
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
Explanation:
- Day 0 (73): next warmer is day 1 (74) → wait 1 day
- Day 1 (74): next warmer is day 2 (75) → wait 1 day
- Day 2 (75): next warmer is day 6 (76) → wait 4 days
- Day 3 (71): next warmer is day 5 (72) → wait 2 days
- Day 4 (69): next warmer is day 5 (72) → wait 1 day
- Day 5 (72): next warmer is day 6 (76) → wait 1 day
- Day 6 (76): no warmer future day → wait 0 days
- Day 7 (73): no warmer future day → wait 0 days

EXAMPLE 2:
Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]

EXAMPLE 3:
Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]

EXAMPLE 4:
Input: temperatures = [50,40,30,20,10]
Output: [0,0,0,0,0]

============================================================

Let's analyze the problem:

We are given an array of daily temperatures, and for each day, we want to find out how many days we need to wait until a warmer temperature occurs. If there's no future warmer day, the answer is 0.

### Approach:
To efficiently solve this problem in **O(n)** time, we can use a **monotonic decreasing stack**. The stack will store indices of days for which we haven't yet found a warmer future day.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Initialize an empty stack to store indices.
2. Create an answer array of the same length as temperatures, initialized with zeros.
3. Iterate over the temperature array:
   - While the stack isn't empty and the current temperature is greater than the temperature at the index on the top of the stack:
     - Pop the index from the stack.
     - Calculate the difference between the current index and the popped index — this is the number of days waited for a warmer temperature.
     - Store this difference in the answer for the popped index.
   - Push the current index onto the stack.
4. After processing all temperatures, any indices left in the stack have no warmer future day, so their answer remains 0.

### Implementation:

```python
def dailyTemperatures(temperatures):
    n = len(temperatures)
    answer = [0] * n
    stack = []  # will store indices of days

    for i in range(n):
        # While current temperature is warmer than the temperature at the top index in the stack
        while stack and temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack[-1]]:
            prev_day = stack.pop()
            answer[prev_day] = i - prev_day
        stack.append(i)

    return answer
```

### Explanation:
- We process each temperature once, pushing and popping indices from the stack.
- When we find a higher temperature, we pop from the stack until the top of the stack has a temperature higher than the current temperature.
- The time complexity is **O(n)** because each element is pushed and popped at most once.
- The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the stack and the output array.

### Testing with the provided examples:

```python
# Example 1
print(dailyTemperatures([73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]))
# Output: [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]

# Example 2
print(dailyTemperatures([30,40,50,60]))
# Output: [1, 1, 1, 0]

# Example 3
print(dailyTemperatures([30,60,90]))
# Output: [1, 1, 0]

# Example 4
print(dailyTemperatures([50,40,30,20,10]))
# Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

This implementation efficiently finds the number of days until a warmer temperature for each day, complying with the O(n) time complexity requirement.
